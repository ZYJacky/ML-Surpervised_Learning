4 Bernardo?
21 Bernardo has my place.
9 And I am sick at heart.
8 For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
6 You come most carefully upon your hour.
15 I think I hear them.--Stand, ho! Who is there?
18 Give you good-night.
2 Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
11 Not a mouse stirring.
